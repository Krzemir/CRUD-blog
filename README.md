<h3>CRUD app - blog site</h3>

Deployed on: https://blog-site-crud-app.onrender.com/
<p>(very limited server hosting performance, please be patient)</p>


The application allows you to add, delete and edit posts, including their validation in terms of meeting the conditions imposed on the form.
It does not support a database or API server at this stage, so the changes made are not saved permanently.
Application created for educational purposes
